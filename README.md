# Next-Word-Prediction-with-LSTM
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a deep learning model for next-word prediction. The model uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), trained on the text of Jane Austen's Emma. An interactive web application is provided using Streamlit to showcase the model's predictions.
